# WealthUp

Hey! This is my clone of the Zerodha trading platform. I built this to learn how full-stack applications work, especially managing user sessions and real-time data.

## What it does
- You can sign up or log in.
- There's a "Demo Account" button if you just want to look around without signing up.
- You can buy/sell stocks (simulated, of course!).
- It has a dashboard that shows your portfolio.

## How to run it
I have two parts here:
1. **Frontend**: The landing page and stuff.
2. **Dashboard**: The main app where you trade.
3. **Backend**: The server connecting everything.

Just run `npm install` in the folders and then `npm start`.

## Tech Stack
- MongoDB for the database.
- Express & Node.js for the backend.
- React for the frontend.

Still working on adding more features!
